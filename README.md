# Safety Glove
## Objective:  
* *Aim of the project is to build a safety device for workers working in industries.*

## About this project:

* *The idea is to design a safety glove consisting of a Hall Effect Sensor, Arduino Mega and a radio transmitter, which is to be worn by the workers in factories who are in close proximity to heavy machinery which can cause potential injuries.*
* *As soon as the gloves are at a dangerously close distance, the machinery will automatically shut down, thus avoiding any damage or injuries.*

## Techstack:
1) *Proximity Sensor (Magnetic Hall Effect Sensor)*<br/>
2) *Arduino Uno/Mega/Nano*<br/>
3) *2-Channel Relay*<br/>
4) *Radio Frequency TX and RX(433HZ)*<br/>
