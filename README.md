# Safety-Glove
* The idea is to design a safety glove consisting of a Hall Effect Sensor, Arduino Mega and a radio transmitter, which is to be worn by the workers in factories who are in close proximity to heavy machinery which can cause potential injuries.
* As soon as the gloves are at a dangerously close distance, the machinery will automatically shut down, thus avoiding any damage or injuries.
